# VirSeqImprover

An integrated pipeline for error-correction, extension, and annotation of viral scaffolds to recover error-free full genomes of viruses and phages by polishing and extending draft viral assemblies.

# Installation

Use conda install to install VirSeqImprover.

```bash
conda install virseqimprover
```

# Run VirSeqImprover

## Input

A viral scaffold/contig and the read sample from which the input scaffold is assembled.
The reads can be paired-end reads or single-end reads. For paired-end reads, two separate read files (.fastq) are needed.
